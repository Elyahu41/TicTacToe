# TicTacToe Android App
This repository contains the joint effort of Elyahu Jacobi, Yosef Cohen, and Jeremy Mandelbaum.
This is one of three separate repositories that the members of the Coding Club of Landers College for Men (2021) have decided to work on.
All three repositories are trying to create a TicTacToe app, we are one of them.

The Goal of the Project is to create a functional TicTacToe android app through Android Studio.

Project Primary Goals:

1. App Launcher Icon
2. App splash screen
3. Title bar displaying TicTacToe or something similar
4. 3x3 board for the users to enter their X or O
5. Each 3x3 slot should be able to represent an X or O through a TextView or a ImageView
6. Underlying code logic for the game. Change turns, and Win / Lose / Tie
7. Not allowing the other player to replace an X or O

This is the bare minimum needed for the project.

Project Secondary Goals:

1. Reset Button
2. App background picture
3. Win Counter
4. Reset board when game is finished
5. Display which turn it is
6. Play against a CPU or AI
