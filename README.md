# TicTacToe Android App
This repository contains the joint effort of Elyahu Jacobi, Yosef Cohen, and Jeremy Mandelbaum.
This is one of three separate repositories that the members of the Coding Club of Landers College for Men (2021) have decided to work on.
All three repositories are trying to create a TicTacToe app, we are one of them.
